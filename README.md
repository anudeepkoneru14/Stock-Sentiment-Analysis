# Stock Sentiment Analysis

Predict stock market movements based on sentiment analysis of news headlines. Utilizes NLP techniques and ML models (RandomForest, Naive Bayes). Compares text vectorization methods. Contributions welcome!

## Overview

This project aims to predict stock market movements by analyzing historical news headlines. It leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models such as RandomForestClassifier and Multinomial Naive Bayes. The project evaluates the effectiveness of different text vectorization methods and welcomes contributions from the open-source community.

## Key Features

- Analyzes historical news headlines to predict stock movements.
- Implements data preprocessing techniques for text data.
- Utilizes machine learning models for sentiment analysis.
- Compares CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer for text vectorization.
- Provides insights into potential areas for improvement and future directions.
